Async/Await : is a pattern to write aschronous more than easily
Async : Allow program execute asynchronous operations
Await: block the below code to wait for asynchronous operation completed. But it will imediately return the Task  => NO BLOCK the Main Thread.
Wait:  block the below code to wait for asynchronous operation completed. No return anything => Block ALL Another Operations( include Main Thread)
** The way we put 'await' will create different asyn/await operations.
 Ex1:
    var r1 = RunTask1();
    await r1;
    var r2 =  RunTask2();
    await r2;
    => Wait for r1 completed -> run r2
 Ex2:
    var r1 = RunTask1();
    var r2 =  RunTask2();
    await r1;
    await r2;
    => r1 and r2 run asynchronously, but wait for the r1 completed firstly 

---------------------
Work with Task
- simple way to create asynchronous task- use Delay() method: 
   await Task.Delay(1000);
