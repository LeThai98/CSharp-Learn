We have a object : DI Container in the DI library -> DI Container is use to register the Class and it's Services.
Class : ServiceCollection is resprent the DI Container.
Flow to register and get service by DI:
    1. Initial DI Container : ServiceCollection Class
    2. Register Services to DI Container
    3. Build ServiceProvider from DI Container: ServiceProvider serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
    4. Get Services from  ServiceProvider
