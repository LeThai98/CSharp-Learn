We have a object : DI Container in the DI library -> DI Container is use to register the Class and it's Services.
Class : ServiceCollection is resprent the DI Container.
Flow to register and get service by DI:
    1. Initial DI Container : ServiceCollection Class
    2. Register Services to DI Container
    3. Build ServiceProvider from DI Container: ServiceProvider serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
    4. Get Services from  ServiceProvider

When we need to configure instance of Service: Use DI with Delegate/Factory

When we need to inject Options of Service , let use Option Design Pattern in DI :  Microsoft.Extensions.Options;( IOptions)
